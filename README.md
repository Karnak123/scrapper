# scrapper
Scrap images from the web

This is a basic version and works only with Chrome 91.*

The current main.py scrapes images for only a single search and stores it in a directory given by the user(absolute path). There is no moderation on the number of results it stores, it just stores all the first page results. Also headless state was not implemented due to lack of WebGL options.
